**1. Choosing the theme**

The theme of my IT certificate project, entitled "The Furniture Shop", was carefully selected, taking into account several important aspects.

I chose to develop a website for a furniture store considering the following reasons:

Opportunity for innovation in the field: Noticing that the furniture field is not as developed online as other fields, we saw an opportunity to bring innovation and improve the user experience by introducing new and useful functionalities.

Accessibility for customers: I wanted to create an accessible and user-friendly online environment for potential furniture buyers, giving them the opportunity to explore and purchase products in a convenient and enjoyable way.

Diversification of services: By introducing functionalities such as furniture restoration, interior design consultancy, and custom furniture design, I wanted to offer customers a wider range of valuable options and services.

The choice of theme was driven by the desire to bring value to an area where I believe there is potential for improvement and innovation. The "Furniture Shop" website aims to offer a pleasant and efficient shopping experience for its customers, being focused on quality, accessibility and diversity.

**2. Applications and Software Used**

**2.1 Supabase, Vercel Github**

For the development and implementation of the "Furniture Shop" project, we used several online services and platforms. Three of these are Supabase, Vercel, and Github.

Supabase.com: We chose Supabase to manage the project database. Supabase is an open-source platform that provides database and authentication services, based on PostgreSQL. This service allowed me to easily create and manage my online store's database, including user authentication functionalities.

Vercel.com: For website hosting and implementation, we chose Vercel. Vercel is a hosting platform for web applications and static websites, which offers a wide range of tools and services for the development and implementation of web projects. We chose Vercel because of its ease of use, high performance, and scalability.

Github.com: GitHub is an essential platform for software project developers, offering a wide range of services and tools that make it easy to collaborate, manage code, and track progress within development teams. I've used GitHub for a variety of reasons, and one of the most relevant to me is its ability to host web projects. For example, I used GitHub in connection with the Vercel platform to host a website. This integration between GitHub and Vercel allows for easy code management and fast and reliable deployment of web projects. Thus, GitHub becomes a solid pillar in my development ecosystem, giving me the tools I need to build and deliver quality web applications.

These platforms were fundamental to the development and implementation of my project, ensuring that the website is well hosted and that the database is managed efficiently.

**2.2 HTML, CSS and PHP**

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is the fundamental language of the web, used to structure and format the content of web pages. Essentially, HTML defines the skeleton of a web page, telling the browser how to display various elements, such as text, images, links, and more. With the help of HTML tags, we can create the logical structure of a web page, including the document head (\<head\>), body (\<body\>), sections (\<div\>), headings (\<h1\>, \<h2\>, etc.) and much more. HTML also provides support for forms (\<form\>), tables (\<table\>), lists (\<ul\>, \<ol\>) and other essential elements for the interaction and presentation of content.

Markup Language:

HTML is a markup language, which means that it is composed of a set of elements and tags that are used to mark and structure the content of the web page. These tags are used to define different elements such as titles, paragraphs, images, links, etc.

Basic structure:

An HTML page starts with a start tag \<html\> and ends with an end tag \</html\>. Inside this element, there are two main sections: \<head\> and \<body\>.

In the \<head\> section information about the page is defined, such as the title, links to CSS or JavaScript files, metadata, etc.

The \<body\> section contains the actual content of the page, such as text, images, links, forms, etc.

Elements and tags:

HTML is built from a set of elements and tags. Each element is defined by means of a start and end tag, which delimits the content of the element. For example:

\<p\>This is a paragraph.\</p\>

The \<p\> tag is the start tag, and \</p\> is the end tag of the paragraph element.

Attributes:

Many HTML tags can also have an attribute, which provides additional information about that element. For example, the tag for an image (\<img\>) can include an src attribute that specifies the source of the image. Example:

\<img src="image.jpg" alt="Imagine"\>

In this example, src is the attribute that indicates the source of the image, and alt provides alternative text that will be displayed if the image can't be uploaded.

Structuring and semantics:

HTML offers a wide range of tags to structure content in a meaningful way. For example, there are tags for headings (\<h1\> to \<h6\>), paragraphs (\<p\>), lists (\<ul\>, \<ol\>, \<li\>), tables (\<table\>, \<tr\>, \<td\>), forms (\<form\>, \<input\>, \<button\>), etc. Proper use of these tags helps improve the page's accessibility and SEO.

Browser compatibility:

HTML is a standard that is recognized and supported by most modern web browsers. However, it is important to write HTML code in a way that is compatible with different browser versions and complies with web standards to ensure that web pages are displayed correctly and consistently across various platforms and devices.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is a styling language used to add appearance and aesthetics to web pages created with HTML. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the appearance and presentation of HTML elements on a web page. Using CSS, we can define the visual styles for different HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, borders, backgrounds, and their positioning on the page. The basic principle of CSS is waterfall, which allows for overwriting and inheriting styles, thus making it easier to create coherent and flexible designs for web pages.

Stylization of elements:

CSS allows you to apply styles (such as colors, fonts, sizes, borders, etc.) to HTML elements. Styles are defined using selections and declarations. For example:

p {

color: blue;

font-size: 16px;

}

This CSS rule will make all paragraphs (\<p\>) have blue text and a font size of 16 pixels.

Selections:

CSS selections are used to specify which HTML elements a particular set of styles apply to. These can be selections of type, class, ID, or other attributes. For example:

p - selects all items \<p\> (paragraphs).

.class - selects all elements that have the class specified in the class attribute.

\#id - Selects the item with the ID specified in the id attribute.

Cascade and Legacy:

CSS is called "Cascading Style Sheets" because styles can be applied in a hierarchy, and conflicts are resolved through inheritance and prioritization rules. For example, a globally defined style may be overridden by a class or ID-specific style.

Units of measurement:

CSS provides a variety of units of measurement for dimensions and distances, such as pixels, percentages, ems, etc. They allow for scalability and flexibility in web page design.

Media Queries:

CSS allows defining specific rules for different device types or screen sizes using media queries. They allow the appearance of the web page to be adapted according to the characteristics of the device on which it is displayed.

Browser compatibility:

Similar to HTML, CSS is a standard that is recognized and supported by most modern browsers. It is important to write CSS code in a way that is compatible with different browser versions to ensure that web pages are displayed correctly and consistently.

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor): PHP is a server-side programming language used for developing dynamic web applications and interacting with databases. PHP allows the generation of dynamic content in web pages, the processing of data entered by users through forms, session management and much more. Offering tight integration with HTML, PHP allows the creation of personalized and interactive web pages tailored to the specific needs of users.

Server-Side Scripting:

PHP is a server-side programming language, which means that the code is executed on the server and the results are sent to the user's browser. This allows the dynamic generation of web content according to various conditions and data.

Interaction with Databases:

PHP is often used to interact with databases, allowing data to be stored and manipulated. Through native functions or libraries such as MySQLi or PDO, PHP can execute queries to databases and manipulate the data returned.

HTML Integration:

PHP code is embedded in HTML documents using special delimiters, usually \<?php and ?\>. This allows developers to create dynamic web pages, where content is generated based on variables, conditions, and other programming logic.

Variables and Control Structures:

PHP supports variables and control structures similar to other programming languages, such as if-else, for, while, etc. They allow developers to control the flow of the program and perform operations according to conditions.

Features and Libraries:

PHP includes a wide range of built-in features and libraries that facilitate common tasks such as manipulating strings, working with files, sending emails, etc. It is also possible to embed and use external libraries for extensive functionality.

Session and Cookie Management:

PHP provides support for session and cookie management, allowing developers to maintain user status between different HTTP requests and customize the user experience according to their actions.

Security:

PHP includes functionality to help secure web applications, such as filtering input data to prevent SQL injections or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and provides features for encryption and password management.

These languages and technologies work together to create a complete and functional website, providing a pleasant and efficient experience for users. By combining their power, we can develop complex and attractive web applications, meeting the increasingly high needs and expectations of online users.

**3.Presentation of the project**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8691df7-1eb3-4867-902c-57bad8ce5659)

The "Furniture Shop" project is a website dedicated to the sale of furniture, which offers a wide range of products and services to its customers. Here's an overview of the site's main functionalities and features:

Homepage: The homepage includes a header and a footer where all the pages of the site are found, providing quick navigation to adjacent pages and pages with information about the store. In the body of the main page, four photos are displayed that direct users to the pages dedicated to specific products (bedroom, living room, kitchen and bathroom furniture).



Product pages: These pages contain a card for each product, which includes an image of the product, a brief description, price, and dimensions of the product. The information is taken from the website's database, where details about each product are stored.



Pages linked to the user account (Login and Sign up): There are two pages for managing the user account. On the Sign up page, users can fill in six fields with the data needed to create an account. This data is then sent to the database, and users can choose to log in or return to the homepage. On the Login page, users need to enter their username and password. The login process involves querying the database for data verification, and if they are correct, a session is created in the database for the user.

**Create and manage user sessions**

To manage user authentication and provide them with a personalized experience within our app, we have implemented a robust session system.

Session identification

To identify a user and manage their session, we use the client's IP address. This is achieved through the get_client_ip() function and is then processed to remove the points and obtain a unique session identifier. This approach allows us to uniquely identify each session and manage user access to the app.

**Create sessions**

When a user successfully logs in, a new record is inserted into the sessions table of the database. This record contains the user ID and the unique session identifier, indicating that the user is logged in and the session is active.

if (pg_num_rows(\$result) \> 0) {

// Authentication successful

\$sessionId = ipToConcatenatedString(get_client_ip());

// Retrieve user ID from the PostgreSQL table

\$getUserSql = "SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = '\$newUsername'";

\$userResult = pg_query(\$dbconn, \$getUserSql);

\$userData = pg_fetch_assoc(\$userResult);

\$userId = \$userData['id'];

// Update the PostgreSQL row in the sessions table

\$updateSql = "INSERT INTO sessions (session_id, user_id, is_active) VALUES ('\$sessionId', '\$userId', true)";

\$updateResult = pg_query(\$dbconn, \$updateSql);

}

1.  Check the results: The if line (pg_num_rows(\$result) \> 0) checks whether the query to the database returned at least one record. This is a verification of authentication success.
2.  Session identifier generation: To create a unique session identifier, the ipToConcatenatedString(get_client_ip()) function is used. This assumes that each session has an identifier consisting of the user's IP address and other relevant information, concatenating them and thus generating a unique identifier.
3.  Obtaining the authenticated user ID: By means of a query to the "users" table in the database, the authenticated user ID is searched, based on the username (\$newUsername). The result is stored in variable \$userId.
4.  Session Table Update: Construct a SQL query to insert a new record into the "sessions" table of the database. This record contains the unique session identifier (\$sessionId), the user ID (\$userId), and an indicator that the session is active (true).

**Session management**

User sessions are properly managed to ensure the security and privacy of their data. This includes updating the status of sessions, for example, when users sign in or sign out.

By implementing this session system, we ensure efficient and secure management of user authentication in our application, while guaranteeing their privacy and security.

These sessions help keep the user signed in to your app. When a user successfully logs in, a new record is added to the database session table, indicating that the user is logged in and that the session is active

This allows the application to keep track of authenticated users and give them continuous access to system functionalities without the need to re-authenticate each time they access.

In order to give the user the possibility to log out in a controlled way, we have implemented a dedicated "logout" button. When the user wants to log out, the action associated with the logout button will trigger a request to the server to delete the corresponding session from the database.

This is accomplished through another SQL query that deletes the corresponding record from the session table based on the session's unique identifier.

\<?php

session_start();

session_unset();

session_destroy();

header("Location: index.php");

exit();

Database: The database schema includes three tables: user, products, and sessions. The user table contains information about users, the products table stores information about each product, and the sessions table manages user sessions.

The connection between the site and the server is crucial for the proper functioning of my application. In this case, my site is hosted on Vercel and the database is on Supabase.

**Defining the database connection:**

**\$dbconn = pg_connect("host=... port=... dbname=... user=... password=...")**

**or die('Could not connect: ' . pg_last_error());**

The line of code establishes a connection to the database using PostgreSQL. pg_connect is a PHP function that connects to a PostgreSQL server. The parameters inside the function are host, port, db name, user, password.

**Processing of data submitted by the user for registration (signup):**

if(isset(\$_POST['save']))

{

\$newUsername = \$_POST['new_username'];

\$newPassword = \$_POST['new_password'];

\$newEmail = \$_POST['email'];

\$newPhoneNumber = \$_POST['phone'];

\$newFirstName = \$_POST['first_name'];

\$newLastName = \$_POST['last_name'];

\$sql_query = "INSERT INTO users (username, password, email, phone, first_name, last_name)

VALUES ('\$newUsername', '\$newPassword', '\$newEmail', '\$newPhoneNumber', '\$newFirstName', '\$newLastName')";

\$result = pg_query(\$dbconn, \$sql_query);

if (\$result)

{

include 'signup-popup.html';

}

else

{

echo "Error: " . pg_last_error(\$dbconn);

}

pg_close(\$dbconn);

}

1.  We check if the data has been submitted for registration (isset(\$_POST['save'])).
2.  If there is data sent, we take it from the form (username, password, email, phone, surname, surname).
3.  We construct a SQL query (\$sql_query) to insert this data into the database.
4.  We use the pg_query function to execute the query on the database connection (\$dbconn).
5.  We check the result of the query execution:
6.  If it's a success (\$result), we include an HTML file to display a success message or registration popup.
7.  If an error occurs, we display it

    (echo "Error: " . pg_last_error(\$dbconn)).

**Login**

To ensure data security and integrity, I have implemented the following security measures within my code:

Use of prepared queries: To prevent SQL injection and to ensure that data entered by users is handled properly, we used prepared queries. They allow the input data to be separated from the SQL command and the parameters to be provided securely. Without the use of prepared queries, data entered by users, such as username and password, would have been concatenated directly into SQL queries. This would have exposed the application to SQL injection attacks.

An attacker could have entered specially crafted data into the authentication fields to alter the behavior of the SQL query and gain unauthorized access to the data in the database. In the absence of prepared queries, the data entered by users would have been treated as part of SQL commands, without any special verification or processing. This would have made the application vulnerable to SQL injection, which could have been exploited to compromise the database and gain unauthorized access to user data.

As part of the development of my app, I conducted a series of tests to assess its security and robustness. One of the key aspects we investigated was the vulnerability to SQL injection attacks, a common issue that can expose sensitive data and affect the integrity of our application.

To test this vulnerability, we simulated a SQL injection scenario in which we manually entered the command ' OR '1'='1' -- in the authentication fields (username and password) of the login form.

SELECT \* FROM users WHERE username='\$username' AND password='' OR '1'='1' --'

In this situation, the OR clause '1'='1' will always be true, ignoring the password and allowing unauthorized access to user accounts.

This command is known to always force the condition to be true, allowing unauthorized access to data in the database.

The result of this test was that I was able to successfully access an account in the database, without having to enter a valid password. This demonstrates that our application was vulnerable to SQL injection and that the data entered by the user was not correctly isolated from the SQL command.

By implementing these security measures, I ensure that my application is protected against SQL injection attacks and that user data is handled securely and fairly.
